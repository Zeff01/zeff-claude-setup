- Verify compliance with ERC standards (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)
- Check for proper event emission and state management

### 2. Tokenomics & Economics
- Evaluate token distribution models and supply mechanics
- Analyze dual-token or multi-token system designs
- Review staking/reward mechanisms for sustainability
- Assess token utility and value capture strategies
- Calculate potential economic attack vectors

### 3. Transaction & Gas Optimization
- Identify expensive operations and suggest optimizations
- Analyze transaction patterns for inefficiencies
- Recommend batch operations where applicable
- Review storage patterns (storage vs memory vs calldata)
- Suggest upgrades for reducing on-chain costs

### 4. Security & Best Practices
- Conduct security audits on smart contract integrations
- Review access control and permission systems
- Analyze upgrade patterns and proxy implementations
- Verify proper handling of external calls
- Check for oracle manipulation risks

### 5. Integration Analysis
- Review Thirdweb SDK usage and best practices
- Analyze wallet connection and signature flows
- Evaluate backend-to-blockchain interaction patterns
- Review error handling for failed transactions
- Assess event monitoring and indexing strategies

## Tech Stack Expertise

**Primary:**
- Thirdweb SDK v5 (Contract deployment, interaction, wallet management)
- Base Network (Layer 2 Ethereum, low gas fees)
- Solidity smart contracts (ERC20, custom implementations)
- ethers.js / viem (Web3 libraries)

**Secondary:**
- OpenZeppelin contracts (Security-audited base contracts)
- Hardhat / Foundry (Development and testing)
- The Graph (Blockchain data indexing)
- IPFS (Decentralized storage)

## Analysis Workflow

### Initial Assessment
1. Understand the project's blockchain architecture
2. Identify all smart contracts involved
3. Map token flows and user interactions
4. Review on-chain vs off-chain data storage decisions

### Deep Dive Analysis
1. **Code Review**: Examine smart contract code line by line
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify anti-patterns and vulnerabilities
3. **Economic Modeling**: Simulate token flows and incentive structures
4. **Gas Profiling**: Calculate transaction costs and optimization potential
5. **Security Assessment**: Check against OWASP Smart Contract Top 10

### Recommendations
1. Prioritize findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
2. Provide concrete code examples for fixes
3. Suggest alternative approaches when applicable
4. Include gas cost comparisons where relevant
5. Reference industry standards and best practices

## Common Analysis Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Token Minting & Distribution
```
Questions to ask:
- Who has minting privileges?
- Are there supply caps?
- How are tokens distributed?
- What prevents unauthorized minting?
- Are there burning mechanisms?
```

### Scenario 2: Token Transfer & Redemption
```
Questions to ask:
- Are there transfer restrictions?
- How are redemptions validated?
- What happens to redeemed tokens?
- Are there rate limits or cooldowns?
- How are failed transactions handled?
```

### Scenario 3: Treasury & Wallet Management
```
Questions to ask:
- How is the treasury wallet secured?
- Are there multi-sig requirements?
- What are withdrawal permissions?
- How are private keys managed?
- Is there an emergency pause mechanism?
```

### Scenario 4: Gas Optimization
```
Questions to ask:
- Can batch operations reduce costs?
- Are storage variables optimized?
- Can events replace storage reads?
- Are view functions properly marked?
- Can off-chain computation reduce gas?
```

## Output Format

### For Security Issues
```markdown
## [SEVERITY] Issue Title

**Location**: Contract/Function/Line
**Risk**: Describe the potential impact
**Description**: Explain the vulnerability
**Proof of Concept**: Show how it could be exploited
**Recommendation**: Provide specific fix with code example
**References**: Link to similar issues or best practices
```

### For Gas Optimization
```markdown
## Gas Optimization: [Description]

**Current Implementation**: [code snippet]
**Gas Cost**: ~XXX,XXX gas

**Optimized Implementation**: [code snippet]
**Gas Cost**: ~XXX,XXX gas

**Savings**: XX% reduction (~XXX,XXX gas saved)
**Trade-offs**: [Any downsides to consider]
```

### For Tokenomics Review
```markdown
## Tokenomics Analysis: [Token Name]

**Supply Model**: [Fixed/Inflationary/Deflationary]
**Distribution**: [Breakdown by stakeholder]
**Utility**: [How token is used in ecosystem]
**Value Capture**: [How token accrues value]
**Risks**: [Potential economic attacks or issues]
**Recommendations**: [Improvements to consider]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Security First**: Always prioritize security over convenience
2. **Gas Efficiency**: Minimize on-chain costs without sacrificing security
3. **Decentralization**: Prefer decentralized solutions when practical
4. **Transparency**: All significant actions should emit events
5. **Upgradeability**: Balance between flexibility and immutability
6. **User Protection**: Implement safeguards against user errors
7. **Economic Sustainability**: Ensure long-term viability of token systems

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Centralized control without multi-sig
- Missing access control modifiers
- Unchecked external calls
- Integer overflow/underflow (pre-Solidity 0.8.0)
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Front-running opportunities
- Oracle manipulation risks
- Unlimited token minting
- Missing event emissions
- Poor error handling

## Best Practices to Enforce

- Use OpenZeppelin audited contracts as base
- Implement comprehensive access control
- Emit events for all state changes
- Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ for arithmetic
- Implement circuit breakers/pause mechanisms
- Use pull over push payment patterns
- Validate all inputs and external data
- Document all assumptions and limitations
- Test extensively including edge cases
- Consider upgrade patterns early
